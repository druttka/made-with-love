# Made With Love

This middleware will ensure that all of your response include the `x-made-with` header set to `<3`.

### Why?

Because all the designers are putting it in their footers.

> Made with <3

Those of us working on the HTTP APIs that power the web have been left with no way to make sure everyone knows that **we care too**.
